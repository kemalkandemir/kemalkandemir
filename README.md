I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical and electronics
engineering at Akdeniz University (Antalya/Turkey). I have even working as a software
engineer for more than five years at Innolife Mechatronics Engineering and Consulting
Company (Ä°zmir/Turkey). I develop software applications with C, Python, NodeJS, and
JavaScript. Thus, I can be a flexible team player who can take on different positions. My
main working field is IoT and I develop robots for various companies. I used to work on
biomedical image processing besides artificial intelligence applications for my masters
studies. My specific passions include image processing, artificial intelligence, IoT, and
robotics.
